\item Problem 17.3.11 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Suppose that the cities in a Euclidean instance of the
    \(\mathrm{TSP}\) are the vertices of a convex polygon.  Then not
    only is the optimum tour easy to find (it is the perimeter of the
    polygon); but the instance has the \emph{master tour property}:
    There is a tour such that the optimum tour of any subset of cities
    is obtained by simply omitting from the master tour the cities not
    in the subset.

    Show that deciding whether a given instance of the
    \(\mathrm{TSP}\) has the master tour property is in
    \(\Sigma_2 \P\).

\item Part (a) of Problem 9.5.4 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Show that the special case of \(\mathrm{SAT}\) in which each
    variable can only appear \emph{twice} is in \(\P\).

  \end{solution}

\item Problem 9.5.6 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Show that the special case of \(\mathrm{SAT}\) in which each
    clause is \emph{either Horn or has two literals} is
    \(\NP\)-complete.  (In other words, the polynomial special cases
    of \(\mathrm{SAT}\) do not mix well.)
