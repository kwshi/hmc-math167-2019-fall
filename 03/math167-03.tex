\item Problem 7.4.4 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Let \(C\) be a \emph{class of functions} from nonnegative integers
    to nonnegative integers.  We say that \(C\) is closed under
    \emph{left polynomial composition} of \(f(n) \in C\) implies
    \(p(f(n)) = \O(g(n))\) for some \(g(n) \in C\), for all
    polynomials \(p(n)\).  We say that \(C\) is closed under
    \emph{right polynomial composition} if \(f(n) \in C\) implies
    \(f(p(n)) = \O(g(n))\) for some \(g(n) \in C\), for all
    polynomials \(p(n)\).

\item Problem 7.4.6 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Define the \emph{Kleene star} of a language \(L\) to be
    \(L^* = \set{x_1 \dots x_k : k \ge 0; x_1, \dots, x_k \in L}\)
    notice that our notation \(\Sigma*\) is compatible with this
    definition).  Show that \(\NP\) is closed under Kleene star.
    Repeat for \(\P\).  (This last one is a little less obvious.)
  \end{book}

\item Problem 7.4.7 of the text.
  \begin{book}
    Show that \(\NP \ne \SPACE(n)\).  (We have no idea if one includes
    the other, but we know they are different!  Obviously, closure
    under some operation must be used.)
